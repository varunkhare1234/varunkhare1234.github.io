Today I have learnt the parsing of XML files to Java code. Cleared a few concepts on Casting and creation of events on android like button click event using listners. The listners here are a bit different to netbeans which made me confused initially :p. The Beginners course was completed today and hence I continued cloud data handling and extraction (intermediate course on Udacity).
