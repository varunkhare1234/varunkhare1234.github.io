We explicitly target the problem of domain shift between the seen and unseen class distribution in Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and seek to minimize it by developing a generative model and training it via adversarial domain adaptation. Our approach is based on end-to-end learning of the class distributions of seen classes and unseen classes. To enable the model to learn the class distributions of unseen classes, we parameterize these class distributions in terms of the class attribute information (which is available for both seen and unseen classes). This provides a very simple way to learn the class distribution of any unseen class, given only its class attribute information, and no labeled training data. Training this model with adversarial domain adaptation provides robustness against the distribution mismatch between the data from seen and unseen classes. Through a comprehensive set of experiments, we show that our model yields superior accuracies as compared to various state-of-the-art ZSL models, on a variety of benchmark datasets.","tags":null,"title":"A Generative Framework for Zero-Shot Learning with Adversarial Domain Adaptation","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["research"],"content":"Neural Networks have been observed to be robust to even adversarial corruptions. However, only a handful of theoretical results exist which guarantee robustness of NNs. We have made an attempt to address this, using results and techniques from robust statistics. To measure the robustness of an algorithm, we want to derive its breakdown point which is the largest number of adversarially corrupted points an algorithm can handle and still guarantee recovery. The presence of breakdown point results for simpler learners like linear regression was a primary motivation to pursue this project using robust statistics.\nTo simplify the problem, we consider the case of regression only single hidden layer neural networks with ReLU activation on each node and an output node with no activation with squared loss function. We analysed two different training procedures and how it can change the training trajectory to affect the final convergence. One apprach utilised the property of ReLU of dividing the input space into 2 halves (active and unactive). Another approach split the problem as a difference of convex functions and we used alternating optimization to train it. This training procedure was well behaved in terms of convergence and theoretically sound.\nFor complete details about these approaches please look in the attached pdf.\n","date":1523420830,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562843626,"objectID":"b3bebe806b09d5ef6969d5292d2cc3fa","permalink":"https://vkkhare.github.io/project/adversarial-corruption/","publishdate":"2018-04-11T09:57:10+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/adversarial-corruption/","section":"project","summary":"This work aims to derive a non-trivial breakdown point for an algorithm for training a single hiddenlayer Neural Network.

We start out by creating a graph which represents the hypothetical world described in the problem with a global function space defining the rules/association between different types of objects.\nWe keep on adding nodes in the graph as when a new object (Noun Phrase) appears in the text and depict the association between two objects by an edge between them. If multiple functions are there multiple types of edges need to be created. If a Noun Phrase is an anaphora, all the objects which would have been linked to this noun phrase would instead be linked with the representative mention and node corresponding to the current Noun Phrase wonâ€™t be added to the graph.\nA set of nodes are eligible as arguments for a function iff they correspond to the object types used in the functional relationship and are connected by edges corresponding to the function. Each measurable quantity has a value attribute associated to it which stores the value of that quantity. Once the graph is generated, we need to calculate the value of the query node. To do this, we traverse the graph starting DFS at query node (Top-Down approach) and check if we are able to calculate its value along any one of the computation path. We work recursively to evaluate all the nodes of the computation path from leaf and then finally evaluate the value of the root node. The following figures explain the graph construction. The implimentation details are available in project report.\nTesting The problems that it could understand were restricted and testing needed a controlled environment. The biggest challenge that we faced was handling prior world knowledge in the system. Currently, we only took those problem which didnâ€™t need this world-knowledge for evaluation. This assumption seems a bit heavy so, we came up with an approach to incorporate it and have left it under future work for testing and validating its effectiveness.\nWe also assumed that the problems didnâ€™t need the knowledge of monotonic nature of the quantities and the association of words to modifications in the values of quantities like Late w.r.t time refers to addition of time to certain time object similarly longer w.r.t distance implies higher magnitude.\nOwing to a deterministic algorithm for query solving, if the system was able to understand the language it gives the correct answer. So, we took a set of 11 different type of problems that needed only Distance = Speed*Time as relationship. Out of these we were able to solve 7 problems some of which are mentioned below:\n How much time Raman will take to cover a distance of 400 km if he runs at a speed of 20 kmph ? The distance between two stations is 240 km. A train takes 4 hours to cover that distance. Calculate the speed of the train. A person runs a distance of 60 km in 5 hours. What is his speed ? Nancy travelled a distance of 455 km by car in 10 hours. Find the speed of the car. Ramesh travels at a speed of 30 kmph for a time of 2 hours to travel a certain distance. How much time will he take to cover that distance if his new speed is 20 kmph? If it takes 3 hours to drive a distance of 192 km on a motorway, what would be your speed?  Future Tasks We propose the following methods to overcome the challenges mentioned earlier and would be following our future work in this direction to improve the system:\n Automating the graph generation for any type of problem\n Graph Neural Nets are highly effective in handling word to graph manipulations. They should work out better in handling linking between different objects. The monotonic and sequential nature of the quantities can be derived using Semantic Role Labeller. This would be helpful in adding word-to-quantity manipulations in general.  Synonymous descriptions like associating length to distance, age to time can be worked by training a ML classifier to associate these labels to noun-phrases. Semantic similarity or paraphrase matching systems might work out better in these.\n There are some relationships which are not given by function space but rather by ownership like a distance travelled by a car is owned by the agent(car). Such relationships can help in handling ambiguity in associating quantities together.\n  ","date":1511411248,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563043677,"objectID":"61a7dedc97ec0bd5dbd8134e14cb3a67","permalink":"https://vkkhare.github.io/project/word-problem-solver/","publishdate":"2017-11-23T09:57:28+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/word-problem-solver/","section":"project","summary":"There is a large disparity in the access to proper education at the school level.
